# Project Goals

Train A Skill is an innovative training platform designed to effectively and promptly assist large organizations in training their personnel. These organizations must have confidence in their systems, which should offer transparent indicators of success to guarantee employee proficiency while supporting essential organizational functions.

When you explore the Train A Skill website, you will encounter two training demonstrations that exemplify the seamless and logical training it offers. Large organizations often face challenges when it comes to elevating staff training to a high standard and ensuring that employees successfully complete verification tests with focus and comprehension.

What sets Train A Skill apart from other training systems is its unique approach. Users are fully immersed in the learning process, with a strong emphasis on evaluating key learning points. Success is achieved only when users fully grasp the material and achieve a perfect score of 100% on each test.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

<img src="asset/css/script/images/Palette.png" alt="home-page" style="width:550px;"/>

1. I chose the color palette to create an office ambiance and selected shades that promote user comfort and a sense of togetherness.

### Imagery

1. All images were selected from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com). I looked for perfossional setting images with the hero image linking to learning.

### Project design plan
<br>

<img src="asset/css/script/images/plan-1.png" alt="home-page" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Design of the home page was entice the user to want to know more, snippits of imformation that set the mission of the site regarding a simple and effective training site. The option of training demos are also made available on the home page.

<img src="asset/css/script/images/plan-2.png" alt="page-2" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 2 was designed to allow the user to add details which would give the certificate a unique feel with the users details being present. This is something that would be added with a back end. 

<img src="asset/css/script/images/page-3.png" alt="page-3" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 3 is the procedure page where the user will conduct thier learning prior to to being tested.

<img src="asset/css/script/images/page-4.png" alt="page-4" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 4 is the test that is followed from the procedure found on page 2.

<img src="asset/css/script/images/page-5.png" alt="page-5" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 5 is the user incentive, a certificate that shows evident of successful training completion.

<img src="asset/css/script/images/page-6.png" alt="page-6" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 6 has been changed, the main reason for this page was show the user that they had made a mistake and would need to start the test again. This was changed as it made more sence for the user to be sent back to the procedure to review instead of having a full new screen to highlight.

<img src="asset/css/script/images/page-7.png" alt="page-6" style="width:450px;"/>

1. Page 7 has also been change for the live production, original plan was for a pop up to be used to show incorrect answer however, this was not going to be suitable for a small device and the pop was removed and the incorrect answer now gets highlighted. A link is also shown and the next button removed so that the user is sent back to the procedure to review.


## Areas that changed during development

* I made the choice to have the procedure flow at the start of the demo instead of a page that is not on the same access line.
* Removed the pop-up from the quiz page for an incorrect answer to better support user access for mobile devices.
* Removed the failed test page, this would of been a waste of time for the user.
* Added a link on any single incorrect answer and halted the test for user to re-train.
* Added Nav bar above hero image.
* Removed the signup demo screen which would be added if backend was available.

# Features

# Testing

The W3C Markup Validator was used to validate every page of HTML code.

Most errors were found on the support page as the examples shown below.

Main error was the use of the anchor as a descendant of the button element.

I found the answer on [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24837102/the-element-button-must-not-appear-as-a-descendant-of-the-a-element) which is a open forum for coding support.

Other errors were a range of unclosed divs.

## User Feedback

* Website was accessed by multiple family and friends who gave the following feedback for bugs and suggestions.

| Page      | Issue/Suggestion | comment                                 |

Website was supplied to two health care professionals who gave the following feedback:

1. Rachel - The website shows some brilliant points and using the twist of a forum is a great idea for sharing and communicating. I do have a suggestion for an update, I think having a section behaviours and looking at the different types of Autism can affect children in different ways. As an example children who are non-verbal communicate in ways such as crying and body movements.

2. Christine - I think it is brilliant youve gone into great detail and covered areas most parents can relate too. ASD is not text book and every child can be different and having the option of information not selected just by the developer will help with sharing that knowledge and information that sometimes would be kept private. PECs cards are an amazing support for children who have not yet found their voice. Good Work!!
